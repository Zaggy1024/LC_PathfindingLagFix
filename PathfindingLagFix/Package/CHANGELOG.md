## Version 1.2.1
- Removed some debug spam that would happen while a Snare Flea is retreating with no target players.

## Version 1.2.0
- Prevent stutters caused by Snare Fleas finding a far location when there are no players to target.
  - This pathfinding would always happen if a Snare Flea spawned while no players are within the building.
  - More often in normal gameplay, it would occur if the Snare Flea fell off the playable area, since this would make all players untargetable, as well as make the search for a far location eventually fail.
  - NOTE: This may not cover all cases of lag caused by Snare Fleas. When they are running from a kill, they look for the nearest location that is accessible out of line of sight. If all line of sight checks fail, there may be stutters.

## Version 1.1.0
- Fixed stutters that would happen when Spore Lizards run from the player.

## Version 1.0.1
- Removed printing of the FlowermanAI.DoAIInterval() bytecode.

## Version 1.0.0
- Fixed stutters that could occur when Brackens are retreating.
- Fixed stutters that always occur when Brackens spawn outside or are not on the nav mesh.
